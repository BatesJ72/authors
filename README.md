# Sales Analysis by Genre for Best Selling Authors

This is an analysis of how many books are sold by genre and by author. The Tableau visualization is located here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/jessica.bates#!/vizhome/SalesAnalysisbyGenreforBestSellingAuthors/BookSales

The purpose of this was to start with a very messy data set, and use Python and Tableau to clean and present the data. The Tableau dashboard uses an interactive parameter so the end user can input the genre they're interested in and update the data to show only that genre.
